# BulletHell
The term "bullet hell" refers to a sub-genre of shooters whose main gameplay focus is dodging seemingly endless waves of colored bullets. 

In Ourgame (Bullet) the player controls a small ship in a sea or character which flies around the environment, shooting at waves of enemies until eventually reaching a stage boss.

A true bullet shooter tests the player's skill in being able to recognize patterns in the stream of bullets and then navigate through the barrage. Bosses will often use complex bullet patterns that restrict the player to very tight safe zones that require maximum precision and focus to survive. 

This game is built for Both operating systems Windows and Mac.
